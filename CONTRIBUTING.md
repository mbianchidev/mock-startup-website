## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any` when possible
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Next.js**: Follow App Router patterns and conventions
- **CSS**: Maintain the existing design patterns and responsiveness
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, satirical names that fit the parody theme

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Good example
interface HeroProps {
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  buzzwordIntensity: 'mild' | 'moderate' | 'extreme';
}

export default function Hero({ title, subtitle, buzzwordIntensity }: HeroProps) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Testing Requirements

- **Existing tests must pass**: Run `npm run test:playwright`
- **New features should include tests** when applicable
- **Manual testing**: Verify changes work in development mode
- **Build verification**: Ensure `npm run build` succeeds

## üé® Design Principles

### Satirical Elements

When adding new content, consider these parody themes:
- **Buzzword overuse**: "revolutionary," "disruptive," "next-generation"
- **Vague value propositions**: Promise everything, explain nothing
- **Startup clich√©s**: Ping pong tables, "changing the world," etc.
- **Enterprise complexity**: Unnecessary charts, diagrams, and processes

### Technical Standards

- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Performance**: Maintain fast loading times
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **SEO**: Use semantic HTML and proper meta tags
- **Static export**: Ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages
