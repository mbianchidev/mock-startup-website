          I was always passionate about computers and technology, but I started coding when I
          was 15. I had switched from a scientific, mostly theoretical high school to what in
          Italy is called a technical high school, where I learned the basics of programming
          and computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was never a good student. School bored me and I never liked studying, but I was
          always curious and loved learning new things, especially when they involved computers
          or music. I played in several bands well before my tech career began. Music did not pay
          the bills, so here I am, working in tech.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Most of my professors told me I would never work in tech because I was not good
            enough. I kept learning on my own anyway.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Many people in my life were not happy with that choice either. They wanted me to go to
          university, get a degree, and find a “real job” instead of “playing with computers.”
          I wanted to work and learn by doing. I also tried to venture into esports, but that did
          not go as expected either.

        <p>
          I started my professional journey in 2015 as a web developer, writing production-grade
          PHP before I had my driving licence.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an employee, I started as a full-stack developer at a small company building
          embedded software in C and internal tools in C#. Then I joined a promising local
          startup, still as a full-stack developer, but back to PHP with a Laravel flavour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only other developer, who was also my mentor, left after just a few weeks. I found
          myself as the only technical person in the building. Fun.
        </p>
        <aside className={styles.marginNote}>
          I never really had a mentor. I had to figure things out by myself and do the genuine
          “fake it till you make it” thing.

        <p>
          After high school I moved to Milan, switched languages to specialise in Java, and built
          my back end as a Software Engineer. I climbed the ladder, worked on large-scale products
          serving more than eight million users at the time—more than ten million today—and
          eventually became a Senior Software Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I am fundamentally lazy, I learned to love automation. I started with Bash scripts
          and moved into DevOps tools and practices.
        </p>
        <blockquote className={styles.dialogue}>
          <p>“Do you know Kubernetes?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
          <strong>I was lying.</strong>
          <span>It was 2018. In Italy, very few people knew what it was.</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I joined the dark side of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering, bringing the best of
          my software engineering background with me. I led DevOps initiatives, improved DORA
          metrics—we measured before changing—and helped multiple teams move from zero to GitOps.

        <p>
          Eventually I hit a ceiling, both at the company where I worked and in the Italian IT
          landscape. Italy did not have a clear Individual Contributor ladder: in most companies,
          you either became a manager or stayed at Senior. That was 2021. Things may have changed,
          and I hope they have; I still have family and friends working in tech there.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I became a freelance professional and something of a digital nomad. I wanted to scale
          my impact on the industry and help more people and companies achieve their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took on far more clients than I could handle. That meant endless weeks, nights, and
          weekends spent grinding. Yes, I made more money than ever before—and, honestly, more
          than I have since. It was a ridiculous amount of money every month.
        </p>
        <p>
          I coached and mentored people on DevOps principles and practices and, in hindsight, on
          Platform Engineering before it was cool, Kubernetes included. I helped companies with
          infrastructure, developer experience, CI/CD, DevSecOps, and the processes around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned more front end, especially React. I always despised JavaScript, but
          TypeScript made me like it a little more. It is still not my thing, but I can live with
          it. Node.js is more fun than I expected; I will give you that. This joined Python and Go
          in my main toolbox, with a pinch of C, C++, and C# from the past. PHP? Gone. I do not
          want to touch it anymore. Sorry.

        <p>
          After working across Europe as a digital nomad, I joined KubeLab in 2023 as a late
          cofounder and CTO. I guided its pivot from a bootstrapped consultancy to a product
          company.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a hell of a year. I enjoyed building a new company culture, revolutionising its
          services, taking a product from zero to one end to end, and caring for my team until the
          very end—even giving up my severance so theirs could be paid. It was only fair. Big tech
          can definitely do better when laying people off for no reason.

          Like many startups, we could not find product-market fit and had to step back. Failure
          became the greatest teacher.

        <p>
          I kept advocating for cloud native technologies. I started contributing to Kubernetes
          upstream in 2024 and, as of 2026, I am still going. I have also been a CNCF Ambassador
          since 2024, with a term set to run at least through 2028.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly believe in the power of Platform Engineering. I co-authored the CNPA exam
          with many smart people from the community, and I look forward to having a further impact
          on the tech industry through my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short chapter at a Y Combinator W22 startup, where I joined as employee number
          15 and became the effective Head of DevRel and Marketing—and the only DevRel, to be
          fair—I joined GitHub as a Solutions Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-sales is not really my thing, but I enjoy talking with customers and diving into the
          nitty-gritty of complex, foundational products such as GitHub Actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to be an AI sceptic. Now I am a very cautious optimist, working on several hobby
          projects I had zero time for before AI. I am also still leading a band in Berlin,
          despite living somewhat close to Amsterdam and travelling fairly often to Italy and the
          United States.
