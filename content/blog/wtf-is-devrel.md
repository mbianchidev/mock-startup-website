# WTF is DevRel?

Developer Relations (DevRel) is one of those roles that can mean a hundred different things depending on who you ask. In this article, I want to share my perspective on what DevRel is, why it matters, and how I ended up in this field.

## What is Developer Relations?

At its core, Developer Relations is about **connecting with developers**, understanding their needs, gathering feedback, and turning that feedback into product improvements. It's also about helping convey your company's mission and vision through content creation, community-building, and educational activities.

DevRel sits at the intersection of:
- **Engineering** - Understanding the technical aspects of your product
- **Marketing** - Communicating value to the developer community
- **Product** - Feeding user feedback back into the development process
- **Community** - Building and nurturing relationships with developers

## The Many Hats of DevRel

DevRel is an umbrella term that encompasses several roles:

### Developer Advocate
Developer Advocates are the public face of a company's DevRel efforts. They:
- Speak at conferences and meetups
- Create technical content (blogs, videos, tutorials)
- Engage with the community on social media
- Gather and relay feedback from developers

### Community Manager
Community Managers focus on building and nurturing developer communities:
- Managing online communities (Discord, Slack, forums)
- Organizing events and meetups
- Fostering positive interactions
- Supporting community members

### Developer Experience Engineer
DevEx Engineers focus on improving the developer experience:
- Improving documentation
- Creating SDKs and developer tools
- Streamlining onboarding processes
- Building sample applications

## Key Aspects of Effective DevRel

### 1. Authenticity
The most effective DevRel professionals are authentic. They genuinely care about developers and aren't just pushing a product. Developers can smell marketing from a mile away, so authenticity is crucial.

### 2. Technical Credibility
You need to understand the technology you're advocating for. This doesn't mean you need to be the best engineer in the room, but you should be able to have meaningful technical conversations.

### 3. Empathy
Understanding developer pain points and challenges is essential. You need to be able to put yourself in their shoes and advocate for their needs internally.

### 4. Content Creation
Creating valuable content is a core skill:
- **Blog posts** - Technical tutorials, opinion pieces, updates
- **Videos** - Demos, tutorials, conference talks
- **Documentation** - Clear, helpful guides
- **Code samples** - Working examples developers can learn from

## How Blogging Helped Me

My journey into DevRel started with blogging. I began writing about cloud native technologies, Kubernetes, and my experiences in the tech industry. Over time, this content:

1. **Built my reputation** - People started recognizing my name and work
2. **Demonstrated expertise** - My technical writing showed I understood the space
3. **Created connections** - Other professionals reached out to discuss topics
4. **Opened doors** - Companies noticed my work and reached out about opportunities

Eventually, a Silicon Valley startup reached out about a DevRel position. They had read my blog posts and saw that I could communicate technical concepts effectively while building genuine relationships with developers.

## The Value of DevRel

Why do companies invest in DevRel?

### 1. Product Feedback
DevRel creates a direct channel for feedback from the developer community back to the product team. This feedback is invaluable for building better products.

### 2. Community Growth
A strong developer community leads to:
- More users and adoption
- User-generated content and support
- Word-of-mouth marketing
- A pool of potential hires

### 3. Brand Awareness
Through conferences, content, and community engagement, DevRel helps establish a company's presence in the developer ecosystem.

### 4. Developer Success
When developers succeed with your product, they become advocates. DevRel helps ensure developers have the resources and support they need.

## Getting Started in DevRel

If you're interested in DevRel, here's my advice:

1. **Start creating content** - Blog about what you're learning and building
2. **Engage with communities** - Participate in online forums, attend meetups
3. **Speak at events** - Start with local meetups and work your way up
4. **Build in public** - Share your projects and learnings openly
5. **Be helpful** - Answer questions, help others, contribute to open source

## Conclusion

DevRel is a unique role that combines technical skills with communication, empathy, and community building. It's not just marketing, and it's not just engineering—it's a bridge between companies and the developers who use their products.

If you're passionate about technology and helping others succeed, DevRel might be the perfect career path for you. And if you're wondering how to break into the field, start by sharing your knowledge and building authentic relationships in your community.
