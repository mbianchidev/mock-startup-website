# Cloud Native Rejekts + KubeCon NA 2024

*Writing this while still recovering from jet lag after returning to Europe from Salt Lake City...*

Another KubeCon is in the books, and once again, Cloud Native Rejekts proved to be an essential part of the experience. Let me share my observations from both events.

## Cloud Native Rejekts

For those unfamiliar, Cloud Native Rejekts is an unconference that happens the day before KubeCon. It features talks that didn't make it into KubeCon's main program—not because they weren't good enough, but because KubeCon has limited slots and many deserving proposals.

### Why Rejekts Matters

Rejekts has become essential for several reasons:

1. **Diversity of topics** - Talks that might be too niche for KubeCon find a home here
2. **Raw and real** - Less polished, more authentic presentations
3. **Community feel** - Smaller venue, easier networking
4. **Early access** - Often previews of emerging trends

### Notable Sessions

This year's Rejekts featured some fantastic content:

- Deep dives into cutting-edge observability patterns
- Honest discussions about platform engineering challenges
- Emerging security practices and tools
- Real-world failure stories and lessons learned

The best part about Rejekts is the willingness of speakers to be vulnerable—sharing failures, challenges, and works-in-progress that you won't hear about on the main stage.

## KubeCon NA 2024

Salt Lake City hosted this year's North American KubeCon, and the conference continues to evolve.

### Observations and Trends

#### AI Everywhere

It was impossible to escape AI at this year's KubeCon. Topics included:

- **AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes** - GPU scheduling, resource management
- **AI for operations** - Using LLMs for troubleshooting and automation
- **AI-generated YAML** - Yes, really
- **Vector databases and RAG** - Supporting AI application infrastructure

The cloud native ecosystem is clearly investing heavily in supporting AI workloads.

#### Platform Engineering Maturity

Platform engineering has moved from buzzword to reality:

- Internal developer platforms (IDPs) are mainstream
- Backstage adoption continues to grow
- Golden paths and developer experience are primary concerns
- Platform teams are becoming established organizational units

#### Security Shift

Security discussions have evolved:

- Supply chain security is no longer optional
- SBOM requirements are driving tooling adoption
- Zero-trust architectures are the expected default
- Admission controllers and policy engines are mature

#### eBPF Revolution

eBPF continues to transform:

- Networking (Cilium is everywhere)
- Observability (lower overhead, deeper insights)
- Security (runtime detection and prevention)
- Debugging and profiling

### The Expo Floor

The expo was massive as always. Some observations:

- **Consolidation** - Several acquisitions announced or rumored
- **AI booths** - Many vendors pivoting to AI messaging
- **Observability** - Still a crowded and competitive space
- **Security** - No shortage of security vendors

### Community Highlights

The best part of KubeCon is always the people:

- **Contributor gatherings** - SIG meetings, contributor summit
- **Hallway track** - Conversations between sessions
- **Evening events** - From vendor parties to informal dinners
- **Reunions** - Seeing internet friends in person

## Key Takeaways

### 1. The Ecosystem is Mature

Kubernetes is 10 years old now, and it shows:

- Core technology is stable and reliable
- Focus is shifting to developer experience
- Edge cases and advanced scenarios getting attention
- Graduation of CNCF projects accelerating

### 2. Platform Engineering is Real

This isn't a fad:

- Organizations are investing seriously in internal platforms
- Tooling is improving rapidly
- Best practices are emerging
- Success stories are being shared

### 3. Security Can't Be an Afterthought

The shift left has happened:

- Security is embedded in platforms
- Policy as code is normal
- Supply chain attacks have everyone's attention
- Compliance requirements are driving adoption

### 4. AI Changes Everything (Again)

Cloud native infrastructure is adapting:

- GPU scheduling and management
- AI workload orchestration
- Data pipeline integration
- MLOps platforms on Kubernetes

## What's Next?

Looking ahead:

- **WebAssembly** - Still emerging, but potential is clear
- **Multi-cluster** - Management and federation improving
- **Edge** - Kubernetes at the edge maturing
- **Sustainability** - Green computing getting attention

## Reflections

Every KubeCon I attend, I'm reminded of how special this community is. The combination of technical excellence and genuine collaboration is rare.

Whether you're a first-time attendee or a veteran, there's always something to learn and people to meet. The cloud native community continues to grow and evolve, and I'm grateful to be part of it.

### Thanks To

- The Rejekts organizers for creating such a valuable space
- The CNCF for putting on another great KubeCon
- Everyone who took time to chat, share, and connect
- The speakers who shared their knowledge and experiences

## Until Next Time

KubeCon EU 2025 is already on the calendar. See you there!
