# RIP DevRel (2010-2024)

As I write this, I can't help but reflect on the state of Developer Relations in 2024. The era of DevRel as we knew it is coming to an end—or at least, the DevRel that emerged over the past decade is dying. But this isn't just a eulogy; it's a critique and a call to action.

## The Rise and Fall

DevRel emerged as tech companies realized they needed dedicated roles to connect with their developer users. The 2010s saw rapid growth in DevRel teams across the industry, fueled by:

- **Abundant VC funding** - Money was cheap, growth was king
- **Developer-first products** - APIs, platforms, and tools targeting developers
- **Community-driven adoption** - Recognition that developers influence purchasing decisions
- **Conference culture** - An explosion of tech conferences and meetups

For years, companies invested heavily in DevRel. Teams grew, travel budgets expanded, and the role became more prestigious.

## Why DevRel is "Dead"

Several factors have contributed to DevRel's decline:

### Economic Reality

The economic climate has shifted dramatically. Tech layoffs have been widespread, and companies are scrutinizing every expense. DevRel teams, often seen as difficult to measure, have been particularly vulnerable.

> "When the money dries up, the first roles to go are the ones that can't prove immediate ROI."

### ROI Challenges

DevRel has always struggled with measurement. How do you quantify:
- Community goodwill?
- Developer satisfaction?
- Long-term brand loyalty?
- Word-of-mouth recommendations?

These are real, valuable outcomes—but they're hard to put in a spreadsheet.

### Mission Drift

Perhaps the biggest problem is that DevRel has drifted from its roots. Too many DevRel efforts have become:

- **Performative** - Focused on vanity metrics and social media presence
- **Marketing-heavy** - Blurring the line between advocacy and sales
- **Conference-obsessed** - Prioritizing speaking gigs over genuine community work
- **Inauthentic** - Losing the developer empathy that made DevRel valuable

When DevRel becomes indistinguishable from marketing, it loses its unique value proposition.

## The Symptoms

You know DevRel is dying when:

1. **Metrics trump mission** - KPIs focus on leads generated, not developers helped
2. **Content becomes corporate** - Blogs read like press releases, not technical resources
3. **Community is a number** - Discord member counts matter more than engagement quality
4. **Events are lead-gen** - Conferences become sales opportunities rather than learning experiences
5. **Advocacy becomes advertising** - Developer advocates become product marketers

## How to Stop Killing DevRel

The mission of DevRel is still worth pursuing. Here's how we can save it:

### 1. Return to Authenticity

DevRel must be genuine. This means:
- Being honest about product limitations
- Advocating for developers, even when it's uncomfortable
- Building real relationships, not just follower counts
- Creating content that helps, not just promotes

### 2. Focus on Developer Success

The goal should be making developers successful, full stop. When developers succeed with your product, the business benefits naturally.

```
Developer Success → Happy Users → Word of Mouth → Growth
```

This flywheel is more sustainable than any lead-gen funnel.

### 3. Build for the Long Term

DevRel is a long game. Community building takes time. Trust takes time. The companies that will have thriving developer communities in 5 years are investing in genuine relationships today.

### 4. Integrate with Product

DevRel should be closely connected to product development. The feedback loop between developers and product teams is one of DevRel's most valuable contributions.

### 5. Measure What Matters

Instead of vanity metrics, focus on:
- Developer satisfaction scores
- Time to first value
- Documentation effectiveness
- Support ticket reduction
- Community engagement quality

### 6. Embrace Technical Depth

DevRel professionals should be technical. Not necessarily the best engineers, but capable of:
- Understanding developer workflows
- Having meaningful technical discussions
- Creating code examples and tutorials
- Contributing to documentation and samples

## The Future of DevRel

I believe DevRel isn't really dead—but the unsustainable, performative version of DevRel is dying, and that might be a good thing.

What's emerging is something more integrated, more technical, and more focused on genuine value creation. This "new DevRel" might look different:

- **More technical** - Closer to engineering than marketing
- **More integrated** - Embedded in product teams
- **More measurable** - Focused on developer outcomes
- **More sustainable** - Built for long-term community health

## A Call to Action

If you're in DevRel:
1. **Reconnect with your mission** - Remember why you got into this field
2. **Advocate fiercely** - For developers, even when it's hard
3. **Create genuine value** - Content that helps, not just promotes
4. **Build real community** - Depth over breadth

If you manage DevRel:
1. **Set meaningful goals** - Developer success, not just leads
2. **Give time and space** - Community building isn't a sprint
3. **Connect to product** - Make the feedback loop real
4. **Trust your team** - Let them be authentic

## Conclusion

DevRel as we knew it might be dying, but developer advocacy is more important than ever. As the tech industry matures and competition intensifies, the companies that genuinely invest in their developer communities will win.

The question isn't whether DevRel will survive—it's whether we have the courage to do it right.
