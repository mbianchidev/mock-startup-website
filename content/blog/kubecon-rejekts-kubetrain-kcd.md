# KubeCon + Rejekts + KubeTrain + KCD = ❤️

There's something magical about the cloud native conference ecosystem. It's not just about the talks or the technology—it's about the community that forms around these events. Let me share my journey from attendee to organizer.

## My Community Journey

### Starting as an Attendee

My first cloud native event was overwhelming. I didn't know anyone, felt out of place, and wasn't sure if I belonged. But I kept showing up:

- Local meetups
- Kubernetes Community Days
- Eventually, KubeCon

Each event, I met more people. Each event, I felt more at home.

### The Turning Point

What changed everything was a difficult period in my professional life. The connections I'd made at community events became a lifeline:

- Friends checked in on me
- People shared job opportunities
- The community provided support

That's when I realized: this isn't just about technology. It's about people.

## The Events Ecosystem

### KubeCon + CloudNativeCon

The flagship event of the cloud native world:

- **Scale** - Thousands of attendees from around the globe
- **Content** - Hundreds of sessions across multiple tracks
- **Networking** - The hallway track is legendary
- **Community** - Contributor summits, SIG meetings, parties

KubeCon is exhausting, inspiring, and essential.

### Cloud Native Rejekts

The unconference that happens before KubeCon:

- **Unique content** - Talks that didn't fit KubeCon's limited slots
- **Intimate setting** - Smaller crowds, better conversations
- **Cutting edge** - Often previews of emerging trends
- **Community feel** - More accessible and personal

If you're going to KubeCon, add Rejekts to your schedule.

### KubeTrain

The train experience connecting European cloud native enthusiasts:

- **The concept** - Travel together to KubeCon EU by train
- **Sustainability** - Lower carbon footprint than flying
- **Community** - Hours of conversation and connection
- **Fun** - It's genuinely enjoyable

KubeTrain, organized with CNCF support, has become an anticipated tradition.

### Kubernetes Community Days (KCD)

Regional, community-organized events:

- **Local** - Bring KubeCon vibes to your city
- **Accessible** - Lower cost than international conferences
- **Community-run** - Organized by local enthusiasts
- **Networking** - Meet people in your area

I went from attending KCD Amsterdam to organizing KCD Utrecht 2023.

## From Attendee to Organizer

### Why Organize?

After benefiting so much from community events, I wanted to give back:

- Create opportunities for others
- Strengthen the local community
- Connect people who might not meet otherwise
- Pay forward what I received

### What I Learned

Organizing KCD Utrecht taught me:

1. **Community is work** - Good events don't happen by accident
2. **Volunteers are amazing** - People give their time generously
3. **Sponsors matter** - They make events accessible
4. **Details count** - Little things create great experiences
5. **It's worth it** - The impact is visible and meaningful

### The Experience

Seeing an event come together:

- Months of planning and coordination
- Stress and uncertainty
- Amazing volunteers stepping up
- The day arriving, people showing up
- Connections being made
- That feeling when it works

It's exhausting and deeply fulfilling.

## Why These Events Matter

### Learning

Conferences accelerate learning:

- Concentrated knowledge sharing
- Access to experts
- Real-world case studies
- New perspectives

You can learn more in three days at KubeCon than months alone.

### Networking

The people you meet:

- Future colleagues
- Mentors and mentees
- Project collaborators
- Lifelong friends

Many of my most important professional relationships started at events.

### Career

Events create opportunities:

- Job leads and referrals
- Speaking opportunities
- Project contributions
- Visibility in the community

My career has been shaped by event participation.

### Belonging

Perhaps most importantly:

- Finding your tribe
- Feeling understood
- Being part of something bigger
- Knowing you're not alone

In a sometimes isolating industry, community provides belonging.

## Getting Involved

### As an Attendee

- **Show up** - Attend local meetups and events
- **Engage** - Talk to people, ask questions
- **Follow up** - Connect after the event
- **Return** - Build relationships over time

### As a Volunteer

- **Help** - Events always need volunteers
- **Organize** - Propose a local meetup
- **Speak** - Share what you know
- **Mentor** - Help newcomers

### As an Organizer

- **Start small** - A meetup, not a conference
- **Find partners** - You can't do it alone
- **Learn from others** - Connect with experienced organizers
- **Leverage existing programs** - KCD has established processes

## Looking Ahead

### KubeCon EU 2024

Paris is calling! I'm excited for:

- The content and learning
- Seeing community friends
- KubeTrain to Paris
- The energy and inspiration

### Growing the Community

I want to:

- Help more people get involved
- Support new organizers
- Expand KCD to more cities
- Keep strengthening connections

## Get Involved

## Conclusion

KubeCon + Rejekts + KubeTrain + KCD = more than the sum of their parts. Together, they create an ecosystem where:

- Knowledge flows freely

- Careers are shaped
- Community thrives

These events changed my career and my life. They can do the same for you.
