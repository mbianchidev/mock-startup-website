This is a series at the third episode, at least.
My usual odd year-end blog post where I reflect on my year and I’m being public with it to have some degree of accountability.

So… 2024 has come to an end, one of the most difficult but also beautiful years of my life.

![That’s me, my last talk of the year, the day-1 closing keynote at KCD Denmark](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yyeB5FudpgFQ6_vGHZLSog.jpeg)

I’m still not very used to living in this country (nordics ndr), I quite like the fast and lean bureaucracy though.
I finally found a way to make music again, a bit with a band and another bit by coaching young metal screamers which is extremely good!
I kept blogging and creating content more regularly even if not as often as I would have.
I did some freelancing which is great and joined another startup.

*Yeeeeah, I said “never again” and jumped right into it a bit like one does after being hangover for a whole day, to just open another beer that night in an endless cycle of pain and regret.*

I participated at KubeCon both in EU and NA — this could be a tradition I keep in the future, who knows.
*Hopefully never again in a mormon and anti-trans state. TLDR; no Utah again, thanks.*

I will organize a KCD in 2025, organized a Cloud Native Day instead in 2024, which is great. I love the community. 
I’m the secretary for the Dutch Cloud Native Foundation, which means I do take a lot of notes and organize most backoffice things.

I re-gained 10 kg and definitely didn’t regularly go to the gym, I travelled a lot (over 11 events and even more flights), so being fit is delayed to 2025.
I’m not stressing too much about it, although my body is telling me I’m getting kinda older. Grey hair and all.

I contributed to OSS a tiny bit more, especially since joining the Kubernetes Release Team, first as Comms Shadow for v1.31 and then as Comms Lead for v1.32

It’s time to take a serious look at [*my last year resolutions*](https://blog.mb-consulting.dev/my-2023-wrapped-28eebcee7006) to see if I followed through and achieved what I expected from myself.

- **Protect my and other people’s well being **🟡
I think I’m being a better version of myself but I failed in setting some boundaries, especially on the professional level but on the bright side I did took care of other people’s well being more than last year, which means I’m on a good trajectory.
I’m proud of some things that I did or that I did (not) do.
- **Find a place to call home **🟡
I said to myself 
“Move the f- away from Northern Europe to somewhere sunnier and warmer, both in terms of climate and people.”
I didn’t do that, I just tried to find sunnier people in the cold weather and let’s say it succeded.
Now, do I feel at home? No.
Is it better than before? Yes!
- **Get to play music more **✅
Started a new music project, took some more students for my vocal coaching… It’s going well!
- **Stay fit **❌
No excuses but yes, I travelled a lot and was quite stressed work-wise this year. It will get better but in the meantime I’ll eat healthier and it should be fine.
- **Don’t stop learning **✅**
**I learnt a ton this year, from how to be a DevRel, create engaging content, manage multiple talks and trips, to more fun things in music and life too.
Tech has been a bit paused on the hard skills, I didn’t pick up Rust as I promised myself to but I did continue experimenting with Kubernetes and avising companies on it so, overall, I consider this a win.
- **Succeed in my new role **❌
I was plain set up for failure on the role itself, but nevertheless I got to deliver impactful talks, including a Keynote and spoke in 8 different countries in 2024. 
My video content also saw a big improvement, including my DaVinci Resolve skills. A loss, with lots of teachings.
- **Foster the relationships I built last year and grow my network **✅
Definitely did that, especially around KubeCon but also outside of it.
Found a great community in Kubernetes and I realized that I was being too professional and cold at times. Trying to be myself more, risky but it pays off in the long run.
- **Learning more about diversity and inclusion **✅
I (still) have a thousand questions about this and I will continue asking those, exactly as last year I’m willing to discuss and most importantly to educate myself, because again: I want to become a better person.
- **Handle my finances (way) better and earn more **✅**
**Kept my finances well in place, all months have been green aside from two slightly negative ones due to big travelling expenses.
I increased my income and still kept the expenses fairly low. 
Not saying I lived a super-frugal life as I went out more often than usual, but overall I would say that I’m not spending and spanding — like we say in Italy.
- **Find time to have fun (so I don’t get a burnout after a few months) **🟡**
**I did find time to have fun AFTER getting a burnout.
At least I did see a lot more concerts this year (5) and plan for more next year (5 booked, 5 considering).
I played quite a bit of MTGA and some other fun game too, my Steam account got finally reactivated after years of inactivity, lol.
Overall? I’m quite drained, but I’m not complaining too much as the future looks a bit brighter ahead.

### Todo list for 2025

- **Work in a company with a good culture**
Priority as this would fix most of the setbacks in the 2024’s list.
- **Take some days off
**Take PTO, do not accumulate it just because, please.
- **Be at peace with not finding a place to call home**
Just make it work somehow, until 2027 when your fiscal benefits will expire, then you can assess and think what to do and where to go next.
You will never find a home away from home and coming back won’t work either: once an expat, always an exapt.
- **Publish new music and/or vocal covers**
Get on the road, record, try out stuff, get with like-minded musicians and create cool and heavy shit.
Karaoke at conferences is still fun, but it’s not enough.
- **Get fit**
Get a gym membership again — maybe one that works in multiple countries, travel (a bit) less, start Yoga or any kind of activity that requires little to no tools.
- **Don’t stop learning
**I don’t think I would but a permanent reminder never hurts.
Goals: Rust, some more Kubernetes — especially around the release engineering subproject.
- **Give back to the community that helped you out in 2024**
Mentor others, review resumes, help out people needing to find a job. Listen to what they have to say, be empathetic.
- **Learning more about diversity and inclusion**
A bit of an evergreen that I like to keep here, as a reminder to be a better person.
- **Enjoy money a bit more
**Last but not least… Spend some more money, a saving rate of 35% on average is good but a 30% is good too.
I find it really useful to publicly state what I will try to do next year, it’s like saying “Hey I’m going to the gym later today” to your housemates so they can shame you in case you don’t.
I support anyone who is willing to share their journey, good or bad, online, in a transparent way.

That said, I wish all of you happy holidays and a happy new year!
Peace out, see you in 2025. 🎁🎄
