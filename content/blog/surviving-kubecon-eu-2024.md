# Surviving KubeCon EU 2024 (Attendee Edition)

KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024 is coming to Paris! Whether you're a first-timer or a KubeCon veteran, here's my quick survival guide to help you make the most of the experience.

## Before You Go

### Set Clear Goals

What do you want to achieve?

- [ ] Learn about specific technologies
- [ ] Network with specific people or companies
- [ ] Find solutions to current problems
- [ ] Recruit or job hunt
- [ ] Contribute to open source projects
- [ ] Just absorb the cloud native atmosphere

Write these down. They'll guide your decisions when overwhelmed.

### Plan Your Sessions

The schedule is massive. Prioritize:

1. **Must-attend** - Sessions directly related to your goals
2. **Would-like** - Interesting but not critical
3. **Backup** - In case primary sessions are full

Remember: all sessions are recorded. You can watch what you miss later.

### Book Early

- **Hotel** - Book close to the venue or with good transit
- **Flights** - Paris has multiple airports, plan accordingly
- **Dinner reservations** - Popular restaurants book up
- **Events** - RSVP to parties and meetups

### Pack Smart

Essential items:

- Comfortable walking shoes (you'll walk miles)
- Portable charger (your phone will die)
- Light layers (venues are often cold)
- Business cards or QR code to your LinkedIn
- Refillable water bottle
- Notebook or notes app ready

## During the Conference

### Day One Strategy

1. **Arrive early** - Beat the registration line
2. **Explore** - Learn the venue layout
3. **Attend keynotes** - Get the big picture
4. **Start networking** - Don't wait until you're comfortable

### Session Tactics

#### Popular Sessions Fill Up

- Arrive 10-15 minutes early for popular talks
- Have a backup session in mind
- Standing room is often available

#### Mix Your Content

Balance across:

- Technical deep-dives
- Case studies and lessons learned
- Introductory/101 sessions
- Community and career talks

#### Take Notes

But not too many:

- Key insights only
- Action items to follow up
- Speaker names to connect with later
- Questions to ask or research

### The Expo Hall

The expo floor is a goldmine if approached right:

**Do:**
- Visit vendors solving your real problems
- Talk to engineers at booths, not just sales
- Collect information, not just swag
- Ask for demos of relevant products

**Don't:**
- Get overwhelmed collecting t-shirts
- Spend all day in the expo
- Ignore smaller booths (often the most interesting)

### Networking Like a Human

#### Starting Conversations

Simple openers work:

- "What brings you to KubeCon?"
- "What have you enjoyed so far?"
- "I noticed your company badge—what do you do?"

#### Making It Meaningful

- Listen more than you talk
- Exchange contact info (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Take a note about what you discussed
- Actually follow up after

#### Evening Events

Paris nightlife + KubeCon = memorable evenings:

- Official parties (networking gold)
- Vendor events (good food, good conversations)
- Informal dinners (often the best networking)
- Community gatherings (find your tribe)

Don't overdo it. Sleep matters.

## Taking Care of Yourself

KubeCon Paris will be intense. Self-care isn't optional:

### Physical

- **Hydrate** - Carry water everywhere
- **Eat** - Don't skip meals
- **Move** - Stretch, take walks
- **Sleep** - 8 hours minimum

### Mental

- **Breaks** - Step outside, find quiet spots
- **Boundaries** - It's okay to skip things
- **Decompress** - Make time for yourself
- **Enjoy Paris** - See something beyond the venue

### Social Battery

Introverts especially:

| If You're Drained | Do This |
|-------------------|---------|
| Between sessions | Find a quiet corner |
| At lunch | Eat alone or with one person |
| Evening events | Leave early, it's fine |
| Overwhelmed | Skip a slot, rest |

## Paris-Specific Tips

### Getting Around

- **Metro** - Best way to navigate the city
- **Walking** - Paris is beautiful on foot
- **Taxis/Uber** - Available but expensive
- **From airports** - RER B from CDG, Orlyval from Orly

### Food

- Conference food is fine but Paris has better
- Grab breakfast at a local café
- Have at least one proper French dinner
- Boulangeries are everywhere and affordable

### Language

- Most people speak English
- Basic French is appreciated: "Bonjour," "Merci," "Parlez-vous anglais?"
- Google Translate helps in a pinch

### Safety

- Paris is generally safe
- Watch for pickpockets in tourist areas and metros
- Keep valuables secure at the venue
- Be aware of surroundings at night

## After the Conference

### Immediate Follow-Up

Within 48 hours:

1. **Connect on LinkedIn** - With everyone you met
2. **Send follow-up emails** - Personalize based on conversations
