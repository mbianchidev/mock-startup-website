# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

While this is a satirical mock startup website, we take security seriously for educational and demonstration purposes. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes             |
| < Latest| ❌ No              |

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Configured in `next.config.js`
- **Static Export**: No server-side vulnerabilities in deployed version  
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates via Dependabot
- **TypeScript**: Type safety reduces runtime errors
- **ESLint**: Code quality and security linting rules

### Security Headers

The application implements security headers including:
- Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email**: security@mb-consulting.dev
3. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, and impact assessment
4. **Response**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours

### What to Include

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Browser, version, and any relevant system info
- **Fix Suggestions**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates the report
3. **Fix Development**: If confirmed, we develop a fix
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with the reporter
5. **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited (if desired)

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merging  
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize any user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Use React's built-in XSS protection properly
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all external resources use HTTPS

### For Users

- **Browsers**: Use up-to-date browsers with security features enabled
- **Extensions**: Be cautious with browser extensions that might modify content
- **Links**: External links open in new tabs for security isolation

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns We Avoid

Since this is an educational project, we explicitly avoid:
- Storing sensitive data (this is a static site)
- Server-side code execution vulnerabilities
- Insecure third-party integrations
- Client-side credential storage
- Unsafe DOM manipulation

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Next.js Security Features

- **Automatic escaping**: React's built-in XSS protection
- **Static export**: Eliminates server-side attack vectors
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time error checking
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy headers

### Build-time Security

- **Dependency scanning**: npm audit during CI/CD
- **Linting**: ESLint security rules
- **Type checking**: Strict TypeScript compilation
- **Static analysis**: Automated security checks
